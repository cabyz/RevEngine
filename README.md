## 🌌 The Vision: Scaling to Escape Velocity
For high-growth startups, **Capital Efficiency** is the difference between survival and death. Most sales compensation models are reactive; **RevEngine** is predictive.

By leveraging **Monte Carlo Simulations**, RevEngine models the probability of revenue outcomes, ensuring your sales commission structures are optimized for **Foundational Profitability** and **Extreme Scale**.

## 🧬 Core Intelligence
- **📉 Capital Efficiency Mapping**: Visualize the direct correlation between OTE, CAC, and LTV-based commission payouts.
- **⚛️ Quantum Predictive Logic**: Run probabilistic scenarios for AE/Setter performance distributions to detect payout cliffs before they happen.
- **📊 Real-time RevOps Intelligence**: Financial-grade modeling for SaaS, Insurance (Optimaxx+), and High-Ticket Sales.
- **🚀 Escape Velocity Modeling**: Identify the exact tipping point where sales efficiency drives autonomous growth.

## 🏗 Technical Architecture
- **Engine**: TypeScript/Next.js for high-speed local inference.
- **Simulation**: Ported from high-precision Python math models for 2025 financial standards.
- **Logic**: Handles Deferred Payouts, Carrier Rates, and SQL-to-Close Funnel Ratios.

## 🚀 Deployment
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cabyz-admin/RevEngine.git
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

## 🧠 Advisor Insight
*This project is built for Founders and RevOps Leaders who treat their sales floor like a high-performance engine. If you can't predict your payouts, you can't scale your company.*
