RevEngine isn't just a dashboard. It is a high-precision, quantitative protocol designed for Founders and RevOps leaders who treat their GTM strategy like a mathematical engine.

While traditional sales dashboards focus on reactive reporting, RevEngine uses **Monte Carlo Simulation** and the **Winning By Design Bowtie Model** to build predictive architectures that prioritize **Capital Efficiency** over brute-force growth.

## ⚛️ Strategic Levers
Most companies fail to reach escape velocity because they stop at the "Funnel." RevEngine models the full **Recurring Impact** journey:
- **Left Side (Acquisition)**: Discovery, Selection, and optimized Purchase velocity.
- **Right Side (Impact)**: Onboarding, recurring Impact, and Expansion-driven Growth.
- **Predictive Unit Economics**: Real-time modeling of CAC/LTV probability distributions.
- **AI Strategic Advisor**: Leverages LLMs to act as a fractional RevOps consultant, analyzing your health scores and suggesting surgical pivots.

## 🛠 Why RevEngine?
1. **Challenge Assumptions**: Move beyond "gut feeling" with thousands of Monte Carlo scenarios.
2. **Bowtie Alignment**: Native support for modern RevOps standards (Winning By Design).
3. **Execution Ready**: Lightning-fast inference optimized for boardroom decision-making.

## 📦 Deployment
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cabyz/RevEngine.git
pnpm install
# To run the core protocol locally:
streamlit run app.py
```

## 🧠 Open Source Ambition
RevEngine is the seed for a global standard in **Quantitative GTM Engineering**. We invite RevOps engineers, Fintech developers, and Growth leaders to contribute to our predictive modules.
